# Linear_Regression_from_scratch

This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression from scratch in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. The implementation is tested on synthetic data to demonstrate the core concepts and functionality of the algorithm.

## File in the Repository

- **linear-regression-from-scratch.ipynb**  
  A Jupyter Notebook that includes:
  - Implementation of Linear Regression without external machine learning libraries.
  - Generation of synthetic data for testing.
  - Visualization of the results.

---

## Features

- End-to-end implementation of Linear Regression:
  - Parameter updates using Gradient Descent.
  - Error computation (Mean Squared Error).
  - Convergence monitoring through iteration.
- Synthetic dataset generation for testing the model.
- Insights into the learning process via visualizations.
